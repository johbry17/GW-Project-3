I've watched it change from a city with no youthful population to one of the most exciting cities in which to live.

I've since studied in Guatemala, Argentina, Italy and The Netherlands. I lived for years in Ecuador and Mexico. I fell in love with culture and how it shapes every part of our lives, even how we think. My best travel experiences are always the ones where I have an unplanned encounter with people I meet along the way. Two very dear relationships in my life today began in the Piazza del Campo in Siena Italy -- 10 years apart! 

HOSPITALITY: My love of hospitality began in Guatemala when I lived with a family for the summer and was deepened when I spent a month in a township in Capetown, SA. The house in Capetown was quite small. My friends insisted that I take their bed and they slept in the living room on the floor. I have since made my home a gathering space for friends and for years was part of an informal house of hospitality where we hosted guests from around the world, well before the days of Airbnb. Now that I have my own home in DC, I am THRILLED to be able to open it up to guests from Airbnb. I hope we get a chance to meet.

LIFE IN WASHINGTON: I moved to DC five years ago. I have grown to love this city, its history, gorgeous architecture, different neighborhood vibes, endlessly interesting people, amazing food scene (cooking, and well, eating, are my other great passions), and plenty of free stuff to do. The day I moved into my house, although it was a cold December day, my neighbors came out  to greet me. Within 2 weeks I was offered Christmas dinner by my next door neighbor because she knew I wasn't traveling to Minnesota for the holidays. DC is much more the nation's seat of power.

I have a toy poodle named Butters and two cats named Cleo and Mocha.  I love to garden, catch a movie and explore the city.

I have 2 spacious bedrooms on the upper floor of my house that I share out one is a King sized mattress and the other is a Queen sized.  Both rooms share one very large bathroom.  Everyone seems to rave about the bathroom. It has a two person Roman tub and a two person walk in shower and double vanity.  Both rooms are fully equipped with extra large TV and computer.  They also are secure with individual keyed door locks for added security.   The price difference is only a few dollars difference so check them both out. If you are wondering where I hang out, well you will find me in my man cave in the basement.  It is quite spacious and secluded with my own private bathroom.

Being that the home is large enough for the three of us, we have enjoyed residents from all over the world. We have enjoyed  wonderful conversations  with them and learned different cooking styles besides getting to know people's cultures in a more intimate fashion. 
We are huge lovers of music and I enjoy singing at church and other cultural venues. 
We have 3 cats but they are only allowed on 2 out of the 4 floors .They are adorable. ( On of the cats is mostly outside, the other hides in my bedroom all day and night and there would only be one to contend with and she has lately been hanging out in my bedroom as well ). So most people who have allergies do not feel a thing in the house  because there are 14 ft ceilings and the air circulation is great. )  
Being that I happen to do property management for a few years, and living in the nation's capitol ,we have enjoyed hosting a lot of interns , professionals, besides masters students who have stayed at the house at different times and  they have made for very enriching conversations !!! 

The neighborhood is just great and we are in the No. 1 area in town - You can just walk down to all the pubs, restaurants and clubs if you wish and the best part is that one could just walk right back home. Our neighborhood is quiet ,peaceful and the neighbors are just wonderful. When you come home to us, you will find the neighborhood very warm and welcoming. 
As a person- I am passionate about relationships, love traveling, love going to great concerts, a lover of gospel , jazz, reggae, pop and even some  classical (Website hidden by Airbnb) a christian ,I am very active with music at church .

I would love to have you stay at the house and help you to discover DC!
There is a lot to see and do in DC and so much of it is free ! ( Its yours for the viewing if you have the time and the inclination!)

I could go on - But I will leave you with this - I look forward to seeing each and every one of you and we will do our best to see that your stay is warm and comfortable! ( And if you get lucky ,you may just avail of some home cooked Indian food as well ) .....

My husband and I are both professionals living and working in Washington, DC.  I'm a DC transplant but -- after ten years here -- I call it home.  We love our neighborhood of Columbia Heights. It gets more exciting each month, with new restaurants and shops opening all the time!  

We both love to cook, entertain friends, and travel.  I've traveled quite a bit but most of my international travel has been through work.  While I didn't get to see as much as a vacationer, I know enough to know the places I want to revisit.  And right now the top of my list is Turkey and Ireland!

After three years hosting people at our house through Airbnb, we have met some really interesting people with great stories and adventures to share.

Feel free to look over my listings and reviews, and don't hesitate to ask any questions you have.    I look forward to chatting with you!

I have decades of hospitality experience in restaurants and kitchens am thrilled to be hosting for the AirBnB community.

A little about me: 
I grew up to the tune of reveille and taps living across the river from an army base in southern Virginia where my folks settled to get away from the hustle and bustle of North Jersey. I attended culinary school at Johnson and Wales University and honed my skills in local kitchens until I moved to DC in 2009. After a short stint experimenting with the west cost way of life, it was clear DC was home so home I went. In 2015, after 15 years experience as a chef, I left my last professional kitchen as a chef and set out to start my own business. SaltSugarFire chef services was born and has since flourished. It's also provided a better work/life balance and encouraged my green thumb!

My hope and desire as an AirBnB host is to use my talents and skills to enrich my guests' experiences and, if I'm lucky, inspire them too.",,,78%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/e57c67ce-b680-494e-a983-eed3822965f2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/e57c67ce-b680-494e-a983-eed3822965f2.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Shaw,19,26,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t

Accordingly, travel is an integral part of our lives. We love to learn about new places, and can think of few better ways to do so than by staying with people from the places we are lucky enough to visit. We also enjoy showing others the secrets of our hometown. Over the last four years, we have made Washington DC our home.

In 2014, he graduated with a master’s degree in music from James Madison University, where he was a teaching assistant and active performer. Long before graduation, he was playing with top performers in both countries.Nirenberg was raised in a family of musicians and studied music since childhood. Becoming a musician was a natural path for him to take. His father plays viola in the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra based in Rio and teaches chamber music at UFRJ. His mother is a gifted pianist who also became a teacher.His paternal grandfather, Jaques Nirenberg, was a doctor and also a respected violinist with the Brazilian String Quartet. For over five decades they performed in concert halls around the world, including Carnegie Hall and Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.  Michel would study classical piano, violin, guitar and clarinet before taking up the saxophone at age 15. The horn was a gift from his parents. Although many family members play music, Michel was unique in making that his primary occupation.His musical style is contemporary Brazilian instrumental music. His latest album shows a fascinating range of influences including choro, the first characteristically Brazilian genre of urban popular music. Choro is characterized by virtuosity, improvisation, and subtle modulations, and is full of syncopation and counterpoint. Nirenberg has the wherewithal to treat it in lively new ways. On the same disc, he performs straight ahead jazz and makes an unexpected leap into the avant-garde on the bonus track.For a long season of his musical life, Nirenberg’s principal influences were classical; later he immersed himself in various styles of jazz and Brazilian styles (choro, samba, and baião, maracatu), and he listened to multi-instrumentalist Hermeto Pascoal and guitarist/pianist Egberto Gismonte.His first recording as a leader is Retrato (Portrait) is set for release on the Carioca label in 2015. It boasts Brazilian musicians such as virtuosos Leonardo Lucini on bass and Alejandro Lucini on drums and guitarist Rogério Souza. Argentine guitarist Dani Cortaza and American pianist Alex Brown complete the roster of highly accomplished musicians with international reputations.Nirenberg is one of the founders of the Philharmonic Band of Rio de Janeiro and was a featured soloist in 2012. He performed classical saxophone solos with the Brazilian Youth Symphony Orchestra and Fundarte Chamber Orchestra. He was also a soloist with the Symphonic Orchestra and jazz ensemble at UFRJ.  Nirenberg’s journey to the U.S. began with a competition in Brazil known as the Concurso Jovens Músicos--Música no Museu, or Competition for Young Musicians, Music in the Museum. After several rounds of competition with talented musicians from throughout Brazil, he won second place and the opportunity for an assistantship at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. In 2014, he received a master of music degree in performance -saxophone – an achievement all the more impressive because Nirenberg faced the challenge of mastering English while undertaking his studies.  Besides English and Portuguese, he is fluent in Spanish and speaks some French, reflecting the wide range of world cultures that influence his approach to music.",,,,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/33054104/profile_pic/1431287786/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/33054104/profile_pic/1431287786/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Bloomingdale,1,1,"['email', 'phone']",t,f

Most of my experiences are characterized by geography and a love of the earth. That said, I grew up in the far northwest corner of South Carolina near in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Alot of my middle and high school memories are characterized by hiking and wandering around the rural areas too elevated for agriculture and too lowland for true Blue Ridge forests. 

I studied Meteorology in Mobile, Alabama. This was a pretty big change for me, but I took well to the beaches, New Orleans, and the Mobile River Delta, which has at times been called ""The Amazon of America"".

I spent a brief amount of time in what is known as the Capital of Louisiana's Cajun Country, Lafayette, Louisiana. Though I had trouble finding access to kayaks to enjoy the slow bayous with, the vibrant culture kept me company. 

Today, I live in Washington DC and do environmental analysis. Nature and the weather remains an important aspect of who I am. Music also remains important to me, though I'm limited in my abilities to play my guitar. My exploratory habits have turned urban, and I enjoy biking around the region. If I've requested to stay with you, it's likely I'm looking for a 'base' to sleep at while I either explore the urban center of the closest city or the nearest mountain, river, or coast to you. If you're looking at this wondering if you should stay with me, I hope you'll choose to visit DC for both the museums and monuments as well as the urban culture of the US's Capital, even if you stay at a different listing.

I work for a DC-based trade association, and love sharing our historic and conveniently located accommodations on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., all of which boast free parking (guests must request a pass prior to arrival), easy keyless entry, safe and walkable neighborhoods with abundant transportation options including bike-sharing, Metro, Uber, Lyft, and two efficient bus systems, and professionally cleaned units. 

We love our historic neighborhood, Capitol Hill, which is centrally located near the U.S. Senate, Supreme Court, Library of Congress, National Mall, Whole Foods, Eastern Market, Union Market and surrounding restaurants, and multiple transportation hubs, and parks—with a lack of hotels as the areas only deficiency. It truly is a neighborhood to immerse oneself as a local. 

We have hosted thousands of guests that have included business travelers here for advocacy work on the HIll, families on vacation, students conducting research at the library of congress, honeymooners, and couples introducing their spouses to their old college or early career stomping grounds. People have come from the farthest corners of the world. 

Are you a foodie? I am! Let me know if you would like the latest recommendations for the best eats in DC, which has experienced a restaurant boom in the past decade. Our electronic welcome packets received after booking are jam-packed with our favorite local restaurant suggestions. 

While we offer complimentary parking passes (by request in advance), our city was planned before automobiles were invented. If you're on the fence about renting a car-I think you're better off without one. Many hot spots are located within a walkable distance, and, public transportation is cheap and convenient. There is also a Capitol Bike Share location mere steps from our home. 

We live in a historic neighborhood with a mix of homes dated before the Civil War, many built during the Victorian era, and historic buildings with modern touches satisfying even the most curious students and lovers of architecture. They have been renovated when possible without detracting from their historic character. Our cleaners have enhanced protocols designed to keep or guests safe and comfortable. 

Guests receive keyless entry codes to access their reserved property. While not often, we on occasion can accommodate an early check-in, however, when it's not possible, we always offer guests the opportunity to store luggage and explore the neighborhood while the cleaners prepare for your arrival. Additionally, we can allow storage post-stay for a specific number of hours as well.  

Send me an inquiry and book your vacation!

Hi there! My name is Candace and I'm a real estate investor. I've owned and managed a rental property for close to 10 years. I’ve had the opportunity to meet amazing people, build lasting friendships, and most importantly help good folks along the way. 

Recently, I've decided to invest real time pursuing my other passions like writing, painting, and traveling. Since making this decision, I published my first book (Spiritual Warfare) and now work as an art instructor. 

I decided to give Airbnb a try because I wanted to provide travelers with  affordable housing so they could really experience all that DC has to offer without wasting money on hotel stays. I also wanted more flexibility regarding length of stays for tenants/houseguests. 

I want my home to feel like a home away from home. My house is comfortable and inviting complete with an additional half-bath, stacked washer/drier, cable and high speed internet. Also, the house has a cozy modern look - ideal for the traveling type.  I share the house with my housemate, Madelyn, who's awesome and has sometimes showed off her baking skills for our Airbnb guests!

Apart from the beauty of the home itself, I live in Northwest Washington DC - near Columbia Heights. This area is perfect for exploration! Fourteenth and Park Road, just a few short blocks away, has new condos, restaurants, a farmers market, shops, live music during spring/summer, and nightlife.  

If you decide to stay with me, you'll definitely enjoy yourself. My hope is that you'll want to visit DC again!

Update- we wed in December 2017, and have since added two wonderful daughters (and a dog) to our family!

Shelby: I'm originally from Pittsburgh, the #1 best city ever, next to DC (and yours of course). I've been in DC since 2009, having moved here a few years after graduating college for a job and because of friends peer pressure, only to fall in love with the city.

""Overall, I am mostly a father, a husband, an entrepreneur, a traveler, a tree hugger,  and a friend to the environment. I love to travel and try to take a yearly vacation with my family and explore the world. During our travels, I find it easier and more efficient to stay with other Airbnb hosts.  Hotels are expensive and would require the booking of 2 rooms. Not very family friendly.

Anand is a native born Washingtonian, who has watched his city go through a roller coaster of change over the last 55+ years. He has been raised here and has worked as a White House photojournalist in the family owned photography business.  

Lisa Marie, who is a full time Interior Artist and Designer in Washington DC, traces her roots from the rolling vineyards and farmlands of the beautiful Finger Lakes of up-state New York.  Her many projects include artistic design, consulting, staging, project management and rehab of numerous high-end commercial and residential projects, in and around Washington DC.

Together, Anand and Lisa have combined their artistic talents to create a dazzling and memorable experience for guests and visitors.

For Anand, hospitality goes all the way back to his father's and mother's humble home, where an endless line of world visitors would stop by on their way through the nation's capital.  As a rule, no one ever left their house without first eating a hot meal and sharing good times with the family.

From Lisa Marie's historic hometown of Seneca Falls, hospitality has been a long tradition, with the many famous bed and breakfast homes in her area. She learned early in life that every traveller's visit and needs are both special and unique.  

""Out goal is always to make sure that every traveller's stay is comfortable, convenient and memorable!""

I may not have another though until around May, but if you have any phobias or allergies, please don't count on that because sometimes I do take emergencies on short notice. 

The weirdness.. I have some allergies, so please please, no scents in the house and you must be a non smoker.

We're an eco-conscious couple who like to live life to its fullest, embrace the good things and good people that are all around, travel a bit, try different ethnic foods from all over the world, explore music from all genres, cook, and entertain in our house! 

In July of 2017, after living in DC's Columbia Heights neighborhood for 5 years and in DC since 2008, my wife and I bought this 104-year-old house (circa 1913) within 5 miles of the White House, and we love living here in our new neighborhood (called Petworth). We knocked out a bunch of walls and replaced just about everything in the house to make it nicer. It needed some serious TLC... Now we want to share it with others who share our love of travel and big-city life. 

My wife is from New Delhi, India, so we go there as often as we are able (not often enough, though). We met in Bloomington, Indiana while she was in graduate school and I was running for County Commissioner of Monroe County. Now we're living it up in the capital city with our 2 young kids (3 and 7). We love DC and feel that it is a real gem of a city. We'd love to share our favorite places with you, help you find the perfect restaurants, and help you find things to do that are off the beaten paths. 

PLEASE NOTE: We do have a cat, so if that's a problem, there's nothing we can do about that. He's a short-haired black tabby cat with some white patches, born in late 2021, and is very friendly, independent, and a bit shy until he warms up to you. His name is Curry (or Curry So Purry according to our kids). He likes people to be around, but he may hide a lot when first meeting new people. 

Our house is in a great neighborhood called Petworth. It's about a 12-minute walk to the nearest Metro subway station (called Georgia Ave-Petworth), and there are bus stops and Capital Bikeshare stations very close to our house, so it's easy to get around! Taxi cabs, Uber, Lyft, and public scooters are also easy to find if you'd rather go that way.

We have lived in Washington, DC now for over 15 years.  Together we enjoy travel, meeting new people, discovering great restaurants, exploring new places and reading great books. Our signature picture was taken in Nosey Bey, Madagascar to give you an idea how much we love travel.  Timothy is a firefighter by trade for 10 years now....a quiet giant who loves helping others.  I'm in the health & wellness business, helping companies and employees promote a healthy, fit culture for over 20 years now.  My how time flies!

 If you do have the opportunity to visit our city be sure to visit the portrait gallery and the botanical gardens my 2 favorite museums!  DC is also home of great food, theater and natural parks so just get out and explore...you'll love it.  

Oh almost forgot to mention ""Je parle francais en peu"" so if you are a native frenchy...bienvenue!

I work in advertising and work from home (or anywhere with WiFi).  I enjoy reading, yoga, hiking, riding horses, playing tennis, skiing, scuba diving, gardening, cooking, camping, music festivals and travel.  

I spend a lot of time in airports, I love hotels and scoping out their pools, lobbies, and hoarding their toiletries.  I love the movie Clue and the band Radiohead.  I like to try new restaurants, and enjoy a good whiskey once in a while.

Here is a little about me:

I attended Plandome Road Elementary School and Manhasset Junior High School in Manhasset, Long Island, New York. Growing up, I was an avid football player and baseball player and tuba player, and I was a camp counselor at Homestead Camp, a Unitarian summer camp in Brewster, New York.

 I went to George School, a Quaker co-ed boarding school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where a generous grading system and a skillful local photographer contributed to my being named a national scholar athlete. At Harvard, I was the thirty-seventh midfielder on the lacrosse team, and I was in the Experimental Theatre. I was a teacher in Gulale, Ethiopia. As part of the college’s Peace Corps program.

 I came to Washington at age 24 because I was interested in the political life. One of my college professors recommended me for a job writing mail for Congressman Stephen J. Solarz, who represented the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York. In 1976, I joined the presidential campaign of Morris Udall, who hoped (unsuccessfully) to join Abe Lincoln and Jack Kennedy on the list of former congressmen who got elected president. The nomination instead went to Governor Jimmy Carter, who won the general election in 1976, about the time I entered Georgetown Law School. One of my professors there recommended me to the office of Vice President Walter Mondale, and I was an intern in his office, working in an architectural marvel--the Old Executive Office building. 

In 1980 my internship led to my becoming Assistant Counsel to the Carter-Mondale Re-Election Committee, a campaign that resulted in a landslide victory for Ronald Reagan. His victory was so large that my hometown congressman, Democrat Lester Wolf, was defeated, which inspired me to go home to Manhasset, and to spend a year and a half seeking the nomination to run for congress myself. A stronger candidate won the nomination, and I moved back to Washington, DC, and hung up my shingle as a trial lawyer.  (I am such a good attorney that I can look at a contract and tell you within five seconds whether it is oral or written!) I practice in the building that contains our Airbnb English basement. 

I can occasionally be seen strumming a Larrivee dreadnought guitar with cracks of unknown origin, and I understand Bob Dylan’s lyrics better than anyone, including Mr. Dylan.

However, my greatest pleasures have been coaching roller hockey, basketball, baseball and soccer, avocations that were facilitated by having five kids.

Your staying with us is greatly appreciated, and I am enjoying seeing my kids’ college tuition balances go down as a result! 

Enjoy!

We live 10 minutes from the Embassy Row, the vice presidential residence, American University and Georgetown University. I enjoy US history and used to work as a tour director for the state department. I absolutely love working in international development and education as well as property management. That's what brought me to Washington, DC originally in 1999 from Grand Forks, ND and Minneapolis, MN. 

Yoga and meditation is my passion. I practice every day. I also enjoy cooking, dancing, biking, skiing, swimming, hiking, traveling, camping, going to theaters, museums, art galleries and exploring the city. 

I reside on Calvert Street NW with two children, Sophia and Viktor, who play the piano, guitar and violin, go to school and help me out with hosting. They are fourteen and eleven years old. We truly enjoy meeting new people and making your stay in the city we adore as enjoyable as possible. My children are Washingtonians, born and raised here.

My motto is 'always learning'! I believe that laughter is the best medicine and we do enjoy a good laugh immensely as a family! In fact, I frequent our local laughter clubs...generating the good vibes and cracking myself up.

So go on, step into a district resident’s shoes for a few days -- enjoy the DC scene with tree-lined neighborhood streets, walk to you favorite brunch place to prolong a lazy morning, and pedal down to the Mall to admire our national treasures. 

And if you have visited my home already, you can probably tell, I like things from an older and simpler time. Don’t let that fool you, I’m not old-fashioned at all. I love the intricacy of new human connections brought on by the modern world. Hence, I always savor the rewarding sensation that comes from experiencing someone else’s world for a few days at a time. 

Though, I am no world traveler (but perhaps you are!), I hope my place -- your temporary home -- is comfortable to you and all visitors from around the globe. I truly hope you enjoy the peace and convenience of it as much as I do. 

Cheers. Travel on.

I own and operate a consulting firm specializing in computer telephony and customer relationship management (CRM) tools. Partnering with small businesses to develop useful custom solutions without breaking the bank. 
Aside from consulting, my partner and I started this venture of Airbnb hosting.  First as a way to cover some extra bills stacking up, but what we found was the guests we hosted were extremely personable and polite and we were making a positive impact with our personal touches.
Home restoration/renovation, wood working, painting, (basically the arts in general) I find enjoyable and fascinating.

I attended Howard University and earned a B.B.A majoring in business administration (mgmt.). Three years fast forward, I returned to Howard University and secured a masters in social work. I also have a license in trichology and salon management. I currently reside here in Washington, DC with my husband and beautiful children. I'm a social worker of over 12 years worth of knowledge and resources in the surrounding DMV. 

I'm a full-time Airbnb host and I manage 2 other properties. I enjoy walking, dinning out at exquisite restaurants, DIY projects, cooking and cleaning. I'm passionate about reading, going to small music venues, and stand-up comedy. I enjoy watching movies, spending time outdoors amongst family and friends, and traveling. My friends describe me as witty, bubbly and energetic. I'm often perceived as a direct communicator. People often compliment me on being attentive. I keep a positive attitude and really enjoy life. My personal goal is to meet at least one new person a day, it makes life far more interesting. 

I starting hosting on Airbnb in 2019. I became an Airbnb host because I love meeting new people. What I love most about being an Airbnb host is sharing my home with people from all over the world. I listed my home (private room) on Airbnb because I want to connect with people from other cultures. I started sharing my spare room on Airbnb to help pay for our children's college education. Although my motivation to list on Airbnb was financial in nature, I really enjoy providing my guests with the best experience possible. I would like to meet more travelers through Airbnb! I live on-site and I'm available if you need anything. I truly love being of service to others. I'm happy to jump on a call and chat to my guests in making their experience more personable. I'm generally quite busy so I prefer to give my guests space to explore the city and all it has to offer. I typically don't spend much time with my guests, but I'm always available if they need me. I'm super social.

Now the lower level/basement unit is a dedicated space where Airbnb guests can stay at an affordable price.

The second listing is in DC. This is an amazing home with open spaces, lots of windows and sunlight, a balcony on the second floor, and completely renovated and modernized. It is an 8 minute walk from the metro, which can take you to all DC attractions, monuments, and museums. The bus system in the city is great and you can also get to the White House or Capitol Hill through bus. You will stay in a cute and modern second floor bedroom. My mom and I live in the basement of this property, but I’m often away in New Mexico. 

What else can I tell you about me? I love philosophy and I'm currently looking for my career path. I studied such philosophy at Williams College in Massachusetts. Williams is a very small liberal arts college located in a beautiful town, extremely warm during the summers and wretched with snow during winter. Thankfully, I love both, the warmth and the snow. I'm looking forward to going back and visiting my family in Colombia, but I'd also love to travel to Thailand or Germany.

I'd love to share this beautiful home with you. Please take a look. I am a very kind host, who loves clean spaces with light. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have. I look forward to hearing from you soon!",within a few hours,88%,74%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4999841/profile_pic/1381711547/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4999841/profile_pic/1381711547/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Northwest Washington,1,8,"['email', 'phone']",t,t

I am guided by the belief your home or the home that you are staying in should support, empower, and encourage you, and all those who enter. 
As a seasoned world traveler, traveling the globe for my “big girl” job in home décor product development, I learned time and time again what was needed to experience the Mettā. A few years ago, I started opening our home--The Mettā Home--to travelers from around the world so they too could experience the Mettā. Mettā is a Buddhist meditation practice believed to heal a troubled mind – to free it from stress, pain and confusion – and to sweeten and change negative thoughts and patterns of mind. Once achieved, mettā is experienced as an all-embracing warmth. I am rooted in these beliefs in every aspect of my life and work, including these beautiful properties I have curated and manage.

With my many connections from around the world and North America I curated and developed Mettā Goods (sheeting, bedding, towels, home décor and furniture) and stocked The Metta Home with the complete line for our guest to enjoy and also purchase.

I am one of those people who LOVE the luxury 5-star experience which is not just a nicely furnished,  clean space, but all the little touches that show you care. The flower on the pillow, the water bottle by the bed, the plugs within easy reach, the high-end bath amenities and coffeemaker you would have for yourself, art and beautiful design, and delightful little surprises like locally made dark raw chocolate and dried fruit on the coffee table.  
When I decided to become an AirBnB host a few months ago, it was because I wanted to share my love of beautiful spaces and the experience of being cared for. I wanted to connect to people whom I will never meet and give them this experience because in the end, we are all connected as one humanity.  

And so far, all of my guests, unknowingly, have repeated exactly this feeling, that my home felt loving and that they felt cared for.  They have left me notes, even flowers and business cards, to extend our connection.  And this gives me great joy.

A few years ago I had the opportunity to visit several Airbnb properties across the world for one month at a time and gained an interest in hosting myself. After experiencing multiple stays, I wanted to create a space where guests can feel comfortable, safe, and entertained, even before exploring the many city attractions.

We offer self check-in at the property. The entrance is located to the left of the property, first door on the right through the alley. Please note, there is a neighbor's dog a few houses down that will bark upon arrival. He's harmless but lives outside and watches the neighborhood! If checking in at night, there is plenty of light in the alley, but we will try to keep the gate unlocked for ease of check-in. Prior to arrival, we'll send a smart lock code via automated massaging so you can always be on your own timeline.

We hope you’re excited for a great trip! Please reach out with ANY questions about the property or city.",within an hour,100%,100%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/04806b97-c5d2-4615-8e1a-5ea87c6f4042.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/04806b97-c5d2-4615-8e1a-5ea87c6f4042.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Northwest Washington,1,1,"['email', 'phone']",t,t

My kitchen where I love to cook and bake (using my fabulous Kitchen Aid mixer).  Although not my dream kitchen yet, at least is decent enough when compared to many NYC apartments.  

In order to cook I need food right?  I live across one of the best NYC gourmet/fresh/organic food supermarkets.  I'm so lucky to buy fresh fish, fruits and vegetables all the time.  

Running is one of my hobbies and I'm lucky to run in one of the worlds best park...beautiful Central Park.  Every season has its charm and it feels that I have a different park every 3-4 months.  One of my biggest accomplishments was running the NYC Marathon in 2011...words can't describe how happy I was to cross the Finish Line.    

Vacation days (and money) to travel.  Some of the US cities I've been to are Boston, Chicago, Miami, Washington DC, San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles among others.  Can't wait to go back to Europe and South America.  

When I'm traveling I like to stay in a clean, quiet and comfortable place.  I'm very neat and organized so where I stay has to be the same.  I like to walk (best way to see everything) so good location and access to public transportation is a must.

I've been fortunate enough to call this house my home since 2015. I am a social creature who loves bringing folks together and being surrounded by good people, delicious food and the flow of good booze. I have been Pzifer vaxxed and boosted. 

My work requires me to be very active, which works well with my bubbly energy. I've worked in education, as well as the distilling and beer industry, and I continue my love for these still. My hobbies include scouring for amazing, reasonably priced vintage pieces of furniture, talking to, watering and admiring all of my plants (I'm bordering on crazy plant lady), wearing, collecting and selling vintage clothes, co-hosting a beer podcast and beer shares, working in the garden and around the house. Coming up very poor with a not so great childhood, I find myself sitting in my house, feeling thankful of where all of my hard work and resilience has led me. The year 2020 took a lot from me, but I was able to still stay in my happy place, aka, my house, but I now find myself with a pretty rad, rarely used basement and wanting to share that space with you on my quest to become a SuperHost. 

If you are into MCM, want to check out my pretty decent vinyl collection, or just geek over some gin or beer, just ask. When I am not working on the never ending to-do lists, I am listening to music in my living room, hanging out on the patio, pulling up weeds (ugh crab grass), or hanging out with friends a local brewery. 

I look forward to meeting you and showing you my southern NC hospitality while being your DC home away from home.

After living in DC since 2008, we finally found an amazing home here and can't wait to share our space with you.  We love the Hill for the wealth of beautiful historic buildings, brick sidewalks, tree-lined streets, and the genuine, friendly feel, while still having the big city at our fingertips.  No matter how short or long you stay, we hope you enjoy the conveniences and benefits of the neighborhood as much as we do, especially our weekly tradition of hitting up Eastern Market.  By day, Rob is an attorney and Torrey is an architect, and we are also proud parents of two young girls and their furry Irish Doodle pup. Our family loves DC life, our local sports teams, and all the cultural experiences available here.  After living in the city for so many years, we have a pulse on the best restaurants and bars in the area and cool sites to see off the beaten path. We also have a great understanding of how to navigate around town, so always feel free to reach out to us regarding Metro, buses, airport transfers etc. We look forward to hosting you!

I understand there are thousands of hosts and properties to choose from and I am grateful that you would take the time to check out mine, my team and I have worked hard on giving you a memorable and enjoyable stay. 

My name is Robert and I grew fond of the idea of hosting short term guests during a stay I experienced in Osaka Japan, I was inspired by my experience there. Our Japanese hosts were so thoughtful in the approach they took in welcoming us. Through that experience I found myself with an urge to create that same experience for others. Out of that was  born a passion for hospitality. Growing up I was always the artsy fartsy type so the transition for me was natural, paired with my logistics background in my Naval career, I took a new passion for hospitality, a natural inclination to create and a trained eye for attention to detail and found Air BNB, now I am on a quest to deliver 100 thousand 5 star experiences for my guests with a goal to grow my hospitality company worldwide! I hope you can join me on this journey, I would love for you to be a part of it. I appreciate your time and consideration.

WHY STAY WITH US 
My husband Jae and I are foodies and adventure seekers who have globetrotted to 5 continents collectively. We understand what makes a good trip. We're a laidback and spontaneous couple who can make you a killer vacation itinerary. Not to mention, we're multilinguists -- primarily English and Spanish, with the rudimentary ability to read some Portuguese and French.

We take pride in opening our home to people and welcome guests to make themselves comfortable, as though they were in their own home. If there is anything that you need, just ask. If we have it, we will usually say yes. For other questions, suggestions and recommendations, we are always happy to assist.

We also specialize in helping people relocate. We moved cross-country to DC from Oakland in 2020 and have tons of tips. If you are attempting to move to either Washington, DC or the Bay Area (Silicon Valley, SF, East Bay, etc.), we are more than happy to help with advice, references and demo'ing apartment search sites, and of course... a place to stay!

I enjoy coaching my son's flag football team, watching my daughter dance, surfing and playing sand volleyball. I also love just a nice day at the beach with family and friends. 

I started OC Beachfront Rentals after using Airbnb a few years ago as a guest when we traveled to Hawaii, Miami and even Ocean City. Through these travels, I've been fortunate to learn what a good Airbnb experience (and host) looks like. A great home, with a friendly host, in an awesome location, and the ability to do the things you love! We started OC Beachfront Rentals with the goal of providing this level of service to all our Guests.  Today we proudly have over 30 stunning Beach properties.

I try to ensure that each and every guest that I host walks away with the very best experience possible!  When I first started my business and still today, I try to answer every phone call or email I get within five minutes. I try and do that today so go ahead and try me you will be amazed at my service.

I enjoy meeting new people and familiarizing myself with other cultures. This is, essentially, why I’ve decided to become a full-time Airbnb host. I’m enthusiastic about investing (real estate, stocks and crypto) and like to eat out and try new restaurants/food. I can easily provide you a list of the best restaurants/entertainment in the area. I’m obsessed with traveling, hence my profile picture – in addition to having traveled all over the US, I’ve visited a lot of countries.
