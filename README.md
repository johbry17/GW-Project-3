## Description

A detialed analysis of Washington D.C.'s AirBnB's, offering a wide variety of metrics for evaluating AirBnB's in Washington, DC, deisgned to help a consumer choose their personal perfect AirBnB. We generate a variety of charts, tables, and an interactive map and make them avialable to the user.

## Usage

`app.py` will launch a Flask development server that you can use to host the website. Click on the website and navigate around it. Interact with the charts and tables and map to gather information and evaluate AirBnB's in DC.

`airbnb` is a backup of the database, that a user can load into a postgres database.

The `/database` folder contains the csv's and SQL code used to create the database. `cleaning data.ipynb` shows the ETL process.

`/exploratory_data_analysis` contains `eda.ipynb`, showing our exploratory data analysis.
